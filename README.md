# Django React.js Primer

A primer for building anything with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Status

This is a work in progress. This repository is basically a stream of
consciousness and a collection of links as I venture into React.js land and try
to figure out how to make it work for my existing Django toolchain.

## Authors Note

My Javascript knowledge is limited to the usual work with jQuery and some DOM
manipulation. Therefore, getting into React and it's vast ecosystem is a major
hurdle for me. After reading blog posts, tutorials and Github repositories
for the past few weeks I feel that I need to write something down in order to
make any progress.
